# Overview {#part:overview}

This section's aim is to provide a step-by-step guide to get started building a new class with Duckietown.

We hope that everything is perfect and easy but if you find yourself needing help please use the links at the bottom of each of the pages to ask questions or look on [the online education forums](www2.duckietown.org/forums/forum/educational).

This guide is primarily targeted at _graduate level_ class preparation. For undergraduate and lower-level classes please stay tuned.
